DissentHub: A Decentralized Platform for DIY Political Dissent
ðŸ“¢ By Sam Aros-Mitchell, Founder

We are in a time where political dissent is increasingly surveilled, suppressed, and erased. DissentHub is my responseâ€”a decentralized, open-source platform that empowers people to use public performance as a form of resistance.

DissentHub is more than an app; itâ€™s a toolkit for secure organizing, performative action, and archiving dissent in ways that cannot be easily silenced. Whether through AR graffiti, sonic protests, flash-mob performances, or encrypted gatherings, it enables activists and artists to reclaim public space and collective voice.

As an open-source project, DissentHub is built by and for the people. It will evolve through contributions from developers, designers, movement organizers, and legal advocates worldwide. I invite you to join me in building a tool that ensures resistance remains visible, audible, and unstoppable.
