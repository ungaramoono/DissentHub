# DissentHub  
### Performance as Protest. Protest as Performance.  

**DissentHub** is an open-source, decentralized platform for DIY political dissent through public performances and demonstrations. Designed for activists, artists, and communities, it provides tools to coordinate encrypted actions, develop performative protest strategies, and archive dissent safely.  

## ðŸš€ Features (In Development)  
- **Anonymous Organizing & Coordination** (end-to-end encrypted, decentralized)  
- **Live Action Sync** (real-time protest activation tools)  
- **Augmented Reality & Sonic Protest Tools**  
- **Legal & Safety Toolkit** (Know-Your-Rights, emergency alerts, surveillance countermeasures)  
- **Decentralized Protest Archive**  

## ðŸŒŽ Open-Source & Decentralized  
DissentHub is built to resist surveillance, takedowns, and censorship. It operates on peer-to-peer networks and open-source infrastructure, ensuring that no central entity can control or erase movements.
